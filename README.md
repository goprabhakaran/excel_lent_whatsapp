Bulk Customised WhatsApp Messages using Excel Macro

Using Excel Macros and WhatsApp Exe we can send customized WhatsApp messages to all/any of our Contacts.

Robin Dunbar may have restricted the number of contacts for meaningful relationships to 150. But, with help of this tool, we should be able to connect to hundreds and hundreds of our contacts and bring in more meaningfully conversations.
We might as well increase the application to a larger audience according to our own used cases.

One is expected to have an active Google account and WhatsApp account besides, a Windows PC/Laptop with WhatsApp Exe and MS Excel installed in it.

Happy Messaging..
